		<h3>The Celtic Cross</h3>

		<p>This popular arrangement, passed down to us from bygone times, gives a nuanced insight into the present situation of the questioner or answers questions about trends in one's career, in relationships, or with regards to special events, etc. It can also be very helpful as a means of orientation and for finding a sense of direction for oneself. The general (personal) question could take the form: How are things now (with such and such) and where will it lead to?</p>

		<div id="the-celtic-cross-layout"></div>

		<ol>
			<li>The initial situation: This is the fundamental issue in question; the most important aspect of the question.</li>
			<li>This crosses the theme: Either it stands in the way or in furthers it (the deciding factor is how the first two cards fit together). This is the other complementary aspect of the question.</li>
			<li>The conscious side (the head): This is known or consciously striven for.</li>
			<li>The unconscious side (the heart): This is felt; the fundamental feeling and the unconscious treatment of the question. Often this is where the roots and causes of the issue lie.</li>
			<li>The recent past: This lies behind it; this has led to it: past experiences that can still have an influence on the matter.</li>
			<li>The near future: This will happen next, this is the way it will go on; an influence that is becoming stronger but not one that will last.</li>
			<li>the current questioner: This is the attitude, the feeling or way of dealing with things, the questioner's general stance towards the issue concerned.</li>
			<li>the external Influences: These come from without (they can be people. events or places).</li>
			<li>The hopes and fears: This is what is expected; either hoped for, or dreaded. Often the hopes are simultaneously the fears. The unconscious attitude of the questioner to the issue is reflected here.</li>
			<li>The outcome: What will happen in the long term: things are tending in this direction if the questioner does not change the situation.</li>
		</ol>

		<h3>The Cross</h3>

		<p>This layout is particularly suitable for beginners because with four cards you can keep a good overview and get clear advice on the question: What should I do, how should I act?</p>

		<div id="the-cross-layout"></div>

		<ol>
			<li>This is what is about: this is the theme.</li>
			<li>this is what I should not do.</li>
			<li>This is what I aught to do.</li>
			<li>This is where it leads to; this is the outcome.</li>
		</ol>

		<h3>The Tree of Life</h3>

		<p>Using this arrangement you can consider a theme more closely and get help in finding the answer to your question.</p>

		<div id="the-tree-of-life-layout"></div>

		<ul>
			<li>3, 5, 8 The column of renewal. that which comes in aid; what furthers one's plans.</li>
			<li>2, 4, 7 The column of dissolution. That which hinders and disturbs; what needs to be overcome.</li>
			<li>1, 6, 9, 10 The column of creation. The issue in question.</li>
			<ul>
				<li>1 This is the theme, the idea, the problem.</li>
				<li>6 The decision; what out to be done.</li>
				<li>9 This is what you must be careful of.</li>
				<li>10 The result; what it leads to.</li>
			</ul>
		</ul>

		<h3>The Relationship</h3>

		<p>This arrangement enables you to obtain clear answers to questions touching on current relationships. It can
		be laid out not just for a love relationship but also every other kind of human relationship (work, family,
		friends). It shows the way partners interact on the rational, emotional and physical planes. You can do the
		reading just by yourself or also together with your partner.</p>

		<div id="the-relationship-layout"></div>

		<p>The two columns show how the partners interact on each level:
			<ul>
				<li>Cards 8, 7 and 6 stand for the questioner.</li>
				<li>Cards 3, 4 and 5 stand for the partner.</li>
				<li>1 the keynote of the relationship: the underlying, currently important aspect of the relationship.</li>
				<li>2 the cross card: a contradictory influence or a complement and support of the first card.</li>
			</ul>
		</p>

		<p>The three levels:
			<ul>
				<li>8 and 3 The rational: how the relationship is consciously perceived and evaluated.</li>
				<li>7 and 4 The emotional: what they each feel in their hearts; their feelings towards each other, their hopes, <li>shes and fears.</li>
				<li>6 and 5 The physical: the outward bearing and behavior of one partner towards the other; mode of communication, sexuality and eroticism.</li>
			</ul>
		</p>

		<h3>The Blockade</h3>

		<p>You feel sad, depressed or blocked and don't quite known why. Not knowing the reason for this feeling it is difficult to change this state. Nothing seems to work and you simply can't make any progress. This mode of reading gives you an impulse to put a name to the feelings and to put them in the context of your experience of life.</p>

		<div id="the-blockade-layout"></div>

		<ol>
			<li>The subject: the question at issue.</li>
			<li>The unconscious: my feelings; what I feel or obscurely sense deep inside.</li>
			<li>The conscious level: what is clear to me and what I am consciously aware of.</li>
			<li>The blockade: what prevents me from making progress, what holds me back, what is blocking my way.</li>
			<li>The step to take to overcome the blockage.</li>
		</ol>

		<h3>The Decision</h3>

		<p>This scheme can be used as an aid in making decisions. Naturally you cannot expect a "yes" or a "no" since no one else can make your decisions for you. However you can gain clarity with regard to the tendencies and outcomes relevant to some particular situation: What will happen if I take a certain course of action? And what will happen if I don't?</p>

		<div id="the-decision-layout"></div>

		<ul>
			<li>1 This is the central issue, the way things stand at present with regards to it.</li>
			<li>4, 2, 6 This is what happens if I decide on this course of action (mostly trying out something new).</li>
			<li>5, 3, 7 This is what happens if I decide not to (to leave things as they are).</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>The Astrological Circle</h3>

		<p>This layout is particularly suitable for consulting the cards comprehensively about the present situation in twelve important areas of one's life. It is also strongly recommended for gaining a general monthly or yearly preview of these areas. I shows which theme figure in the various areas concerned.</p>

		<p>The cards are shuffled and fanned out face down. The questioner draws twelve cards with the left hand, turns them up in a circle and a reading is made. If one or the other card is unclear and you would like an indication of a general trend you could add one or two extra cards to obtain a more comprehensive statement. The additional cars should however only be drawn when the first cards give no clear picture, or when an area particularly affects the person involved.</p>

		<div id="the-astrological-circle-layout"></div>

		<ol>
			<li>This represents oneself: The underlying mood; the questioner's physical and mental state; what one shows to the world; how one goes about tackling a task on the basis of one's spiritual and intellectual endowment.</li>

			<li>The circumstances of the everyday life: Ways of thinking, spiritual development, acquiring knowledge. the state of one's every day life.</li>

			<li>Vocation: What the questioner strives for and the direction in which the work situation is developing; career; talents and abilities; success and recognition; personal principles.</li>
			<li>Friends: Experiences within the circle of one's friends; useful but also burdensome friendship; hospitality.</li>
			<li>Secret matters: The soul; deep longings and fears; what has been deeply repressed; resistances and defensive behavior that restrict freedom of movement; the inward path and the sensing of one's own limits, proving oneself; compulsory break; the inexplicable.</li>
